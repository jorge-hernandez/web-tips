Illustration of the use of express generator.

Install:

npm install express-generator -g

generate:

express folder_name

run:  npm start

For an example of adding your custom modules, 
1. clone the modules-and-tips folder
2. Copy the content of the api folder in modules-and-tips to routes in generator folder
3. Modify the app.js for require and use those modules (do a diff between the generated app.js vs the one on this repo))


test:

localhost:3000/dishes
localhsot:3000/dishes/1
